"About1" = "Three levels is a method of setting and achieving goals created by Mirek Burnejko. It consists in setting a large, main goal with an expected date of achievement, and then dividing it into 3 smaller levels - each with an expected date of achievement. After completing each level, you reward yourself. Bottle wine, dinner at a restaurant, excursion - you choose. Set the prizes in advance. Create a separate budget for them. Never forget about them.";
